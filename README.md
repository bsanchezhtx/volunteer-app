- Clone the repo and run `npm install` in both the front end and backend folders
- Both ends can be run using `npm run dev`

The backend needs a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder, a `.env.example` file is included with the necessary environment variables to modify if being run in a new environment.

For now, the backend is using JSON as mock database tables, located in `backend/data`.
